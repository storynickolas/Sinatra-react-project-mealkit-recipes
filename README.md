# Mealkit Recipes

![Sample Page](https://github.com/storynickolas/mealkit-recipes-frontend/blob/main/Sample%20Images/Meal%20Kit%20Sample.png)

This respository offers the basic code for a Sinatra API backend created to be used by [Meal Kit React App Repository](https://github.com/storynickolas/mealkit-recipes-frontend).  This repository was initially created as a fork of [Learn Co Starter Code](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/phase-3-sinatra-react-project)

This API offers two models: one for recipes and another for the ingredient list of each recipe.  Recipes can be added, created, edited and deleted from the front end application.  Additional ingredients can also be added.  Active Record is utilized to sort the recipes in various ways before being sent to the front end.
